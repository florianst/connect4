	abstract="In this paper we present a new symbolic algorithm for the classification, i. e. the calculation of the rewards for both players in case of optimal play, of two-player games with general rewards according to the Game Description Language. We will show that it classifies all states using a linear number of images concerning the depth of the game graph. We also present an extension that uses this algorithm to create symbolic endgame databases and then performs UCT to find an estimate for the classification of the game.",
