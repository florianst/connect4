As a counterexample, we could take a grid as simple as three variables that are all directly interconnected.

We would pose the conjecture that *all* cycles in the grid need to be of even length for this to be possible. "

However, by mere definition of the marginal polytope and of linear problems, we need to have a corner that is a *better* solution then ours. This is a contradiction."
